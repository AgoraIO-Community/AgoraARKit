# AgoraARKit
Enabling apps to live stream AR video streams. **[ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/)**, uses the device's camera and motion sensors to project virtual conetent into a user's world. **Agora.io**, provides a [video SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/product_video?platform=All%20Platforms) for building real-time video and audio communications applications. By combining Agora.io's Video SDK and ARKit, it enables developers to create many different applications across many different use-cases. 

This library provides three classes with managed user itnterfaces:
- Lobby: the pre-channel UIView, provides a text input for users to define their channel name and their role (broadcaster and audience)
- ARBroadcaster: User broadcasting their AR view in the live stream
- ARAudience: User viewing the remote user's AR session.

## Device Requirements
AgoraARKit requires a minimum version of iOS 12.2, and supports the following devices:
- iPhone 6S or newer
- iPhone SE
- iPad (2017)
- All iPad Pro models

iOS 12.2 can be downloaded from Appleâ€™s Developer website.

## Dependancies
AgoraARKit relies on the Agora.io Video SDK and ARVideoKit.
